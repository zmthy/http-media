Changelog
=========

- Unreleased(minor)

  Added support for parsing structured syntax suffixes on media types,
  as described in [RFC 6839](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6839).

- [Version 0.8.1.1](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.8.1.1)

  Fixed a bug when mapping againt a client-side content header where a
  match would be overridden by a more specific key earlier in the map.

  The bounds for tasty have been updated to include the latest version.

- [Version 0.8.1.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.8.1.0)

  Exposed `qualityData` accessor.

  Added `isAcceptable` to allow filtering out unacceptable items.

- [Version 0.8.0.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.8.0.0)

  Removed official support for GHC 7.8.

  A separate `QualityOrder` type can now be extracted from a `Quality`
  value for performing comparisons without the attached data value.

  The most specific match will now be used to assign a quality value to
  each server option, ensuring that less specific matches cannot
  override lower quality values on more specific matches. In particular,
  if a type is considered unacceptable by the client, then a separate
  match with a non-zero quality value cannot make it acceptable.

  Numeric characters are now permitted in the tail of a Language value.

  Added support for Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding.

  Added support for Accept-Charset and Content-Charset.

  The bounds for QuickCheck have been updated to include the latest
  version.

- [Version 0.7.1](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

- [Version 0.7.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

  The Travis configuration has dropped support for GHC 7.6 and added
  support for 8.0.

  More direct constructors for quality values are now available, to
  avoid having to deal with `Maybe` results when you are certain parsing
  a quality string will not fail.

  version.

- [Version 0.6.4](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.4)

  Parse failures more regularly return a `Maybe` value instead of
  raising an exception.

  The `(//)` smart constructor now accepts wildcard arguments, but only
  in the correct order.

  Most tests will now emit a counter example if their relevant
  properties are violated.  Some tests which were not correctly covering
  their properties have been fixed.

  The `-Werror` flag has been removed from the test suite.

- [Version 0.6.2](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.2)
